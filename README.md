# üèùÔ∏è Islandy

> Islands meet Express.js & Preact

Islandy is a modern web framework for JavaScript developers focused on progressive enhancement. It's designed to create accessible, performant and high-quality web applications, based on [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Peact](https://preactjs.com).

Islandy is a combination of Express.js and Preact that renders pages on demand, on the server. Also provides an interface for seamlessly rendering some components on the client for maximum interactivity: Islands.

The Islands architecture encourages ship less JavaScript to the user with small, focused chunks of interactivity within server-rendered web pages. The output of islands is progressively enhanced HTML, with more specificity around how the enhancement occurs.

Some stand out features:

- Zero config necessary
- Server side rendering by default (no client JavaScript is required)
- Optional client side hydration of individual components (islands)
- Supports all the features that are offered by Express.js & Preact
- File-system routing with middlewares
